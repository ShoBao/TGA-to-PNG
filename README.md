# 🎨 TGA to PNG Drag-and-Drop Converter

This Python script lets you easily convert your `.tga` texture files to `.png` by dragging and dropping them onto the script.

## 🤔 How It Works

- **Drag one or more `.tga` files** onto the script.
- **Watch them automagically** become `.png` files in the same folder.
- File conversion is powered by [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org), a Python imaging library.

## 👍 Requirements

- Python 3.x (any modern version is fine)
- Pillow  
  Install with:
  ```
  pip install Pillow
  ```

## 📝 Usage

1. Place the script wherever you want.
2. Drag and drop your `.tga` files onto the script in Windows Explorer.
3. Done!  

## 😏 Why Use This?

- No nonsense GUI
- Batch-converts files
- Perfect for game modders, artists, or anyone poking around old texture formats

## 🥱 Credits

- Script by ShoBao
- Built with Python and Pillow
- Inspired by my laziness, so hopefully I help you achieve maximum efficiency with maximum laziness.
